  Both agents start adjacent and must compete for resources.
  
  With cutoff=5, the agent explores thousands of game states.
  
Expected:
  - Adversarial: Agents split roughly evenly (5-6 each), racing to grab vertices
  - Total of 12 people should be rescued
  - Should complete in reasonable time despite large search space

Running: 12-vertex clique, cutoff=5, Adversarial...

  Grid topology forces interesting path choices.
  
Expected:
  - Agents should efficiently cover the grid
  - Adversarial: Competition for central vertices

TEST 4: High-Value Target Competition
======================================================================

Description:
  10 vertices arranged with a central high-value target (V5 = 50 people).
  Other vertices have 1 person each.
  Both agents start equidistant from V5.
  
  Tests whether agents correctly prioritize the high-value target.
  
Expected:
  - Adversarial: Agent 0 (first mover) should grab V5 (50 people)
  - The winner should have significantly more than the loser

Running: Adversarial, cutoff=5...
  Agent 0: 55 rescued
  Agent 1: 4 rescued
  Total:   59 rescued (max possible: 59)
  Time: 0.14s

======================================================================
TEST 5: Flooded Roads and Kit Strategy
======================================================================

Description:
  Graph with strategic flooded roads blocking direct paths to people.
  Agent 0 starts with access to a kit.
  
  V1 (kit) --[FLOODED]-- V2 (10 people)
    |                      
  V3 ---- V4 ---- V5 (10 people)
    |
  V6 (Agent 1 start)
  
  Agent 0 must decide: equip kit (slow but direct) or go around?
  
Expected:
  - Agent 0 should use kit to reach V2
  - Agent 1 takes the longer path to V5
  - Both groups of 10 should be rescued

Running: Adversarial, cutoff=6...
  Agent 0: 10 rescued
  Agent 1: 10 rescued
  Total:   20 rescued (max possible: 20)
  Time: 0.06s

======================================================================
TEST 6: Deadline Pressure - Triage Scenario
======================================================================

Description:
  12 vertices with people, but deadline only allows partial coverage.
  Tests whether agents prioritize correctly under time pressure.
  
  Agents must make hard choices about who to save.
  
Expected:
  - Not all 12 people can be saved
  - Agents should maximize rescues within the deadline
  - Adversarial: May see competition for nearby vertices

Running: Adversarial, deadline=5, cutoff=4...
  Agent 0: 5 rescued
  Agent 1: 5 rescued
  Total:   10 rescued (max possible: 12, but deadline limits this)
  Time: 0.04s

======================================================================
TEST 7: Cooperative Kit Sharing
======================================================================

Description:
  Single kit, two flooded paths to different groups of people.
  
  V1 (kit) ---- V2 (agent 1)
                 |
         [FLOOD] | [FLOOD]
                 |
          V3----V4
        (10p)  (10p)
  
  Only one agent can use the kit at a time.
  In fully cooperative mode, agents should coordinate kit usage.
  
Expected:
  - Adversarial: Agent 0 takes kit, gets one group. Agent 1 stuck.
  - Fully-Coop: Should ideally coordinate to rescue both groups

Running: Adversarial, cutoff=6...
  Agent 0: 20, Agent 1: 0, Total: 20
